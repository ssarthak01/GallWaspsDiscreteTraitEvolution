EBIO 4290/5290 Final Project: Evolution of Number of Gall Chambers in Association to Gall Location

What are gall wasps? Insects, Cynipidae, that inject their eggs into plant tissues resulting in the host plant forming an external structure around the larvae, known as a gall. The gall acts as a protective layer for the larvae and is their source of nutrients. Moreover, the gall is created from the plant tissue itself. Galls can vary in complexity, number of chambers, attachment form, and location.
